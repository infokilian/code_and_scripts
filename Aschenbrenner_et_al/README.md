This part contains the public code for the analysis parts performed by me as part of the publication 
"Disease severity-specific neutrophil signatures in blood transcriptomes stratify COVID-19 patients" (Aschenbrenner et al., 2021; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13073-020-00823-5).
This code was used to create Figure 2f and the entire code of the publication for all figures can found in the following repository:
